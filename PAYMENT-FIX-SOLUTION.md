# 💰 PAYMENT FIX SOLUTION

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUE:**
The NFT collection is minting for **FREE** instead of requiring **0.1 SOL payment**.

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE:**
When we removed the candy guard to fix the mint authority issue, we also removed the payment requirement. Now the collection mints for free.

## 🎯 **SOLUTION OPTIONS:**

### **Option A: Deploy New Candy Machine (Recommended)**
1. **Create new config** with proper payment guards
2. **Deploy new candy machine** with payment requirements
3. **Update frontend** to use new candy machine ID

### **Option B: Fix Current Candy Machine**
1. **Add payment guard** back
2. **Set mint authority** to null for public minting
3. **Test payment requirements**

### **Option C: Frontend Payment Handling**
1. **Remove guards** completely
2. **Handle payment** in frontend before minting
3. **Send payment transaction** separately
